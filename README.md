This is a mild ransomware solution for research and testing. Written in C++ for Win32, with the Crypto++ library.

For testing purposes, this uses a hardcoded key in the AES encryption.

Much thanks to the authors of the Crypto++ library, see their license in the library folders.

## Requirements
C++ Runtime build tools in the IDE you prefer, with support for C++17 (e.g. VS2022).
